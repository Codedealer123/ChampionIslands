CodedealerDoodles
=============================

This is a  copy of the Doodle Champion Island Games by Google and Studio 4Â°C.
The game has been modified to forcefully load the English text and force fullscreen, as well as some other minor improvements,
like turning off smoothing on Gecko-based browsers (and forcing moz-opaque), as well as fixing an issue with web browsers not supporting the Web Audio API.

Preferably, you should play the game on google.com, but if for some reason it is blocked
or you wish not to be tracked (note that for now, the submit score url is still used, and it still loads the leaderboard from Google's servers, that may change later),
